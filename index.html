      <h3>Projects</h3>

      <div class="project">
        <h5>Sysco Enterprise App</h5>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Spring Boot, React.js, PostgreSQL, AWS</p>
        <p>This application supports Sysco‚Äôs food product management system. I led the transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices, significantly improving performance and modularity. I designed and implemented secure RESTful APIs for product and pricing management, used Swagger for interactive documentation, and integrated PostgreSQL for persistent storage. The frontend was built using React.js with Redux, implementing reusable components and dynamic filtering. The services were containerized with Docker and deployed to AWS, using EC2 for compute and RDS for storage, while Jenkins automated CI/CD processes. The platform now supports faster deployments and improved availability.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h5>BNSF Claims Processing System</h5>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Angular 9, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, AWS</p>
        <p>The Claims Management System automates the submission and resolution of union worker disputes. I developed Angular components for multi-step workflows, real-time status updates using RxJS, and JWT-based secure access. On the backend, I created Spring Boot services that supported lifecycle phases such as submission, arbitration, and escalation. PostgreSQL was used with Spring Data JPA for managing structured claim data. The entire solution was deployed to AWS using EC2, and integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration and testing. This streamlined claim resolution processes and improved record transparency.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h5>MidFirst Digital Banking Platform</h5>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Angular 10, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, OAuth2, AWS</p>
        <p>I worked on enhancing the MidFirst Bank's online banking platform, redesigning dashboards and secure user workflows. I built reactive Angular forms for KYC validation, implemented token-based authentication via OAuth2, and integrated external APIs for credit checks. Backend services included payment processing and notification triggers, developed using Spring Boot and secured via Spring Security. PostgreSQL was used with Hibernate, including audit logs and transaction history. The solution was hosted on AWS with EC2, RDS, and S3, with operational monitoring via CloudWatch. The improvements enhanced the user experience and security of online banking features.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project">
        <h5>Kohl's E-Commerce Platform</h5>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> React.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, Kafka, Spring Boot</p>
        <p>This e-commerce application supported real-time inventory updates and personalized shopping experiences. I created reusable React components for cart, checkout, and product filtering, and integrated GraphQL for optimized API calls. Kafka was used to handle asynchronous updates like cart actions and shipping notifications. On the backend, Spring Boot handled promotions, pricing logic, and session tracking, while MongoDB managed unstructured catalog and user behavior data. We deployed containerized services in Kubernetes, with CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins. The project improved load times and increased conversion rates during peak sales events.</p>
